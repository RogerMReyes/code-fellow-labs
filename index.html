        Bio:
      </h2>
      <p>
        I am currently 26 years old and live in the Tacoma, WA area. I am prior military serving 7 years in the US Army.
        I joined the military a year after highschool mainly from my initial experiences of going to college and getting
        out into the job field. In the Army I worked as a Satellite Communications Technician which allowed me to work
        in Japan for the last 4 years of my career. After finishing up my contract I decided to go to school in order to
        pursue the actual field I was interested in which was Software Development. After once again trying out college
        I felt I wanted to focus solely on code and languages which led me to Code Fellows. My current goals is to
        expand my knowledge as much as possible in multiple different languages with an emphasis in Java.
