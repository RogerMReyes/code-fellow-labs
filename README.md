## Lab 02

The beginning of an about me page that so far contains my personal bio. When someone first visits the page they are met with a series of prompts that will ask them yes or no questions. They're answers are stored in variables that determine the alert reply that they will end up receiving.

### Reflections and Comments

In this lab we went over many concepts such as variables, operators, and comparison operators. A lot of what was gone over today translated pretty well with my previous experience in Java. Something that really interested me about JavaScript was the "looseness" of the language. Compared to Java which is a strict language I could see a lot of positives and negative to having a looser language. When comparing the two I do prefer the strictness as it makes things simpler in my mind.

## Lab 03

This lab was focused on loops and implementing them within our script to give the user multiple chances at guessing the answer to the questions given. There was also more experimentation with CSS and structuring the page better.

### Links and Resources

I had some issues with re-introducing the bullet points for an un-ordered list after the CSS reset. The following link helped clarify what needed to be done.

### Reflections and Comments

This was a very interesting lab where I got to test the limits of loops and arrays. The stretch goal of storing the first five questions into an array and using a loop to simulate the flow was a great exercise and helped me understand JavaScript logical processes better.
