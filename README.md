## Lab 02

The beginning of an about me page that so far contains my personal bio. When someone first visits the page they are met with a series of prompts that will ask them yes or no questions. They're answers are stored in variables that determine the alert reply that they will end up receiving.

### Reflections and Comments

In this lab we went over many concepts such as variables, operators, and comparison operators. A lot of what was gone over today translated pretty well with my previous experience in Java. Something that really interested me about JavaScript was the "looseness" of the language. Compared to Java which is a strict language I could see a lot of positives and negative to having a looser language. When comparing the two I do prefer the strictness as it makes things simpler in my mind.
